Not the typical app store downloads with ads and in-app purchases, but clean, educational web-based games that just work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Try the first game&lt;/strong>: &lt;a href="https://iuffxguy.github.io/kidsgames/dotgame/bubble-game.html">Bubble Pop Game&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-vision">The Vision&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The goal is to build a series of HTML5 games that are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Touch-optimized&lt;/strong>: Designed specifically for tablet interaction&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Educational&lt;/strong>: Subtly teaching concepts like counting, colors, patterns, and problem-solving&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Distraction-free&lt;/strong>: No ads, no external links, no data collection&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Offline-capable&lt;/strong>: Can be saved as bookmarks and work without internet&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Progressive&lt;/strong>: Games that adapt difficulty as kids improve&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Instead of native iOS apps, I&amp;rsquo;m going with web games for several reasons:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Found the first mobile game I ever built</title><link>https://iuffxguy.github.io/posts/ti-83-programmer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2023 21:40:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://iuffxguy.github.io/posts/ti-83-programmer/</guid><description>&lt;p>Link: &lt;a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/2/280.html">https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/2/280.html&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 1997, a &amp;lsquo;mobile&amp;rsquo; device was a bit different than today&amp;rsquo;s amazing phones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By learning TI-83 Basic I got my first introduction into loops, conditional statements, &amp;ldquo;functions&amp;rdquo;, and much more. It was all so fascinating to me that I could build programs and play them all on this same device that I could bring anywhere with me (including school).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What was weird about coming across this was my close friends know I have always had a strange obsession with horse racing. I had forgotten that I built this betting/racing simulator on my TI-83 when I was 15.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
