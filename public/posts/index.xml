      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about creating a collection of simple, engaging games that my kids can play on their iPad. Not the typical app store downloads with ads and in-app purchases, but clean, educational web-based games that just work.&#xA;Try the first game: Bubble Pop Game&#xA;The Vision The goal is to build a series of HTML5 games that are:&#xA;Touch-optimized: Designed specifically for tablet interaction Educational: Subtly teaching concepts like counting, colors, patterns, and problem-solving Distraction-free: No ads, no external links, no data collection Offline-capable: Can be saved as bookmarks and work without internet Progressive: Games that adapt difficulty as kids improve Why Web Games?</description>

      <description>Link: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law&#xA;I find this law really interesting because of the many ways it impacts our lives. The idea that things will always find a way to fill the free space you give it makes sense when you think of ways we see this in our everyday lives such as:&#xA;The extra storage which seemed huge when you first bought your house is now full years later Always needing more hard drive space A simple task can takes weeks to get done if you give it weeks to get done What&amp;rsquo;s more interesting to me though is how this applies to companies as well.</description>

      <description>Link: https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/2/280.html&#xA;In 1997, a &amp;lsquo;mobile&amp;rsquo; device was a bit different than today&amp;rsquo;s amazing phones.&#xA;By learning TI-83 Basic I got my first introduction into loops, conditional statements, &amp;ldquo;functions&amp;rdquo;, and much more. It was all so fascinating to me that I could build programs and play them all on this same device that I could bring anywhere with me (including school).&#xA;What was weird about coming across this was my close friends know I have always had a strange obsession with horse racing.</description>
