      <description>Link: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law&#xA;I find this law really interesting because of the many ways it impacts our lives. The idea that things will always find a way to fill the free space you give it makes sense when you think of ways we see this in our everyday lives such as:&#xA;The extra storage which seemed huge when you first bought your house is now full years later Always needing more hard drive space A simple task can takes weeks to get done if you give it weeks to get done What&amp;rsquo;s more interesting to me though is how this applies to companies as well.</description>
