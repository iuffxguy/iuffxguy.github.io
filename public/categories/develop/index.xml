      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about creating a collection of simple, engaging games that my kids can play on their iPad. Not the typical app store downloads with ads and in-app purchases, but clean, educational web-based games that just work.&#xA;Try the first game: Bubble Pop Game&#xA;The Vision The goal is to build a series of HTML5 games that are:&#xA;Touch-optimized: Designed specifically for tablet interaction Educational: Subtly teaching concepts like counting, colors, patterns, and problem-solving Distraction-free: No ads, no external links, no data collection Offline-capable: Can be saved as bookmarks and work without internet Progressive: Games that adapt difficulty as kids improve Why Web Games?</description>

It was all so fascinating to me that I could build programs and play them all on this same device that I could bring anywhere with me (including school).&#xA;What was weird about coming across this was my close friends know I have always had a strange obsession with horse racing.</description>
