In 1997, a 'mobile' device was a bit different than today's amazing phones. 

By learning TI-83 Basic I got my first introduction into loops, conditional statements, "functions", and much more.  It was all so fascinating to me that I could build programs and play them all on this same device that I could bring anywhere with me (including school).

What was weird about coming across this was my close friends know I have always had a strange obsession with horse racing.  I had forgotten that I built this betting/racing simulator on my TI-83 when I was 15.
