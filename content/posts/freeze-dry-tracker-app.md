For years I've wanted to create and launch my own iPhone app, but the complexity of mobile development always felt overwhelming. With all the advancements in AI tools lately, I figured this was as good a time as any to finally make it happen. Using Cursor as my AI coding companion, I was able to build an entire app from scratch - something that would have taken me months before took just weeks.

The app tracks freeze-dried food inventory, which might sound niche but is actually quite useful for anyone into emergency preparedness or long-term food storage. Building it required setting up a complete backend that talks to Supabase for data storage and user authentication, plus learning the Expo framework for React Native development. Expo turned out to be fantastic - it handles the build process seamlessly, provides over-the-air updates so you can push fixes without App Store approval, includes a great development environment with hot reloading, offers easy access to native device features, and simplifies the entire deployment process to both iOS and Android app stores.

The app is now live on the App Store and I'm honestly amazed that I was able to go from idea to published app so quickly. If you're interested in tracking your freeze-dried food supplies, you can download [Freeze Dry Tracker App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/freeze-dry-tracker/id6748582588).
